## Technical Working Behind the Scenes
BookWise uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)**, which processes the text of books and generates relevant multiple-choice questions. The app's architecture consists of:
1. **Text Generation**: The LLM analyzes a book's content and generates questions based on key topics, characters, themes, and plot points.
2. **Question Formatting**: The generated questions are then formatted into a multiple-choice style with one correct answer and several distractors.
3. **Streamlit Interface**: The app utilizes **Streamlit** to deliver a smooth, interactive quiz-taking experience. It allows users to select a book, take the quiz, and receive a score in a user-friendly layout.
